#### Hi! I'm Niki Manoledaki, a Software Engineer working on cloudy things, currently at Weaveworks. ☁️


#### Cloud Native
Previously, I was a maintainer of **eksctl**, the official open-source command-line interface (CLI) for **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service** (EKS). Part of this engagement involved coordinating with AWS to maintain parity with EKS for features such as IPv6, EKS Anywhere, and Karpenter support. Another part was engaging with and aiding the growing **community** of eksctl users.

I also have experience building multiple **APIs / features for cloud platforms** using **cloud native tools** and their APIs or SDKs, such as Kubernetes, Flux, Terraform, Helm, Prometheus, Jaeger, OpenTracing, gRPC, and many others.

#### Environmental Sustainability

Currently, most of my work encompasses investigating the **environmental impact of cloud native technologies**. 

This primarily includes measuring and optimising for **energy** consumption or **carbon** emissions. It includes thinking creatively about smarter resource allocation, for example, to reduce cost in similar ways to FinOps.

As part of this effort, I co-founded and lead the **internal Environmental Sustainability Working Group** at Weaveworks.

#### CNCF

I actively collaborate with, contribute to, and continuously learn from the **CNCF** communities of the **Environmental Sustainability TAG** and the **GitOps Working Group**.

I will deliver the following talks at the upcoming **KubeCon** + CloudNativeCon NA 2022 conference:
- [⚡Lightning Talk: Green(Ing) CI/CD: A Sustainability Journey with GitOps - Niki Manoledaki, Weaveworks](https://gitopsconna22.sched.com/event/1AR8Y)
- [Panel Discussion: Moving Towards Environmentally Sustainable Operations with Cloud Native Tools - Niki Manoledaki & Chris Lavery, Weaveworks; Marlow Weston, Intel; William Caban, Red Hat](https://sched.co/1AsRi)
- [Tutorial: How To Write a Reconciler Using K8s Controller-Runtime! - Scott Rigby, Somtochi Onyekwere, Niki Manoledaki & Soulé Ba, Weaveworks; Amine Hilaly, Amazon Web Services](https://kccncna2022.sched.com/event/182Hg)
