Hi! I'm Niki Manoledaki, a (Cloud) Software Engineer currently at Weaveworks.

Previously, I was a maintainer of eksctl, the official open-source command-line interface (CLI) for Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). Part of this engagement involved coordinating with AWS to maintain parity with EKS for features such as IPv6, EKS Anywhere, and Karpenter support. Another part was engaging with and aiding the growing community of eksctl users.

I also have experience building multiple APIs / features for cloud platforms using cloud native tools and their APIs or SDKs, including Kubernetes, Flux, Terraform, Helm, Prometheus, Jaeger, OpenTracing, gRPC, and many others.

Currently, most of my work encompasses investigating the environmental impact of cloud native technologies. This primarily includes measuring and optimising for energy consumption measuring and optimising for carbon emissions, as well as smarter resource allocation and FinOps. As part of this effort, I co-founded and lead the internal Environmental Sustainability Working Group at Weaveworks. I actively participate, contribute to, and continuously learn from the CNCF communities of the Environmental Sustainability TAG and the GitOps Working Group.

I will be delivering the following talks at the upcoming KubeCon + CloudNativeCon NA 2022:
