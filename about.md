## Software Engineer
I build, maintain, and operate cloud native and open source software (currently, autoscalers for cloud cost reduction) and advocate for sustainable computing. ðŸŒ±

<br>

## Environmental Sustainability Advocate

I am passionate about investigating the **environmental impact of cloud-native technologies**.

This primarily includes monitoring and optimising around **energy utilization and carbon emissions**.

<br>

## Cloud Native Ecosystem Contributor & Speaker

I actively collaborate with, contribute to, and continuously learn from **CNCF** communities.

One of these communities is the [Environmental Sustainability TAG](https://github.com/cncf/tag-env-sustainability), where we aim to raise awareness and find solutions around environmental sustainability in the cloud-native space.

I often spend time coaching folx who are trying to learn to code or learn about cloud-native software, especially under-represented minorities in tech. Do reach out if this sounds like you!
